# Text Summarization with BART

## Overview

This project provides a simple implementation of text summarization using the Hugging Face `transformers` library with the `facebook/bart-large-cnn` model. The BART model is a powerful transformer model designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks, making it particularly effective for generating coherent and contextually relevant summaries from long texts.

## Features

* **Pre-trained Model** : Utilizes the `facebook/bart-large-cnn` model for high-quality summarization.
* **Customizable Summary Length** : Allows users to specify the maximum and minimum lengths of the generated summary.
* **Easy to Use** : Simple function to summarize any input text with minimal setup.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.6 or higher
* Pip for package management
